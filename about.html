    <!-- Content -->
    <h3>I graduated with my Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2020. Through extracurricular activities in high school and undergrad, in addition to my professional career, I have over 6 years of experience using CAD and engineering principles to design mechanical systems and components. This experience includes designing complex assemblies with parametric CAD software, applying engineering principles such as stress analysis and material selection, and validating designs through FEA and CFD simulations. Over the years, I have worked on a variety of projects, from robotics subsystems to prototype development for early-stage startups, gaining practical skills in manufacturing, assembly, and performance optimization.</h3>

    <h3>In my free time, I enjoy working on cars, cooking, and playing sports like volleyball, cricket, and soccer. I also have a passion for camping and other outdoor activities, and Iâ€™m an aspiring wildlife photographer.</h3>
